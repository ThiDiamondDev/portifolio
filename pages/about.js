                &emsp;Hello! Iâ€™m a web and mobile developer with experience in
                game development and 3D modeling and sculpting. I specialize in
                creating interactive and engaging experiences for users. My
                skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, NodeJS, Blender,
                and now my focus is build experiences with Unreal Engine.
                <br />
                <br />
                &emsp;I have a strong understanding of user experience and
                design principles. I am skilled in creating responsive designs
                that work seamlessly across different devices. I am also
                experienced in creating 3D models and animations that can be
                used in games and other interactive applications. I am
                passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest technologies
                and trends in the industry to ensure that my clients receive the
                best possible solutions
                <br />
                <br />
                &emsp;With Unreal Engine 5, I have worked on the top of the new
                features, like Lumen, Nanite and Procedural Content Generation,
                creating beautiful, optimized and functional experiences using
                Blueprints. I also have solid skills in programming languages
                like C++, python and JavaScript to integrate in any project and
                build solutions at scale.
